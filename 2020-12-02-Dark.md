Dark is a German scifi show about the fictional town of Winden. When I had some down time over the past few days, I decided to give it a watch. It's come highly recommended from several people I know. I'd actually attempted to watch it years ago, when my knowledge of German was still very, very basic. I thought I'd be able to better my German and understand the show (German audio and German subs), but I was not prepared at all. Fast forward to 2020 and I have a better command of German and (perhaps more importantly) I turned on the English subtitles. Turns out being able to understand what's going on makes Dark a much more intriguing show. I binged the first season over a few days and am now taking the second season at a much more reasonable pace. It's available for streaming on netflix and I highly recommend it if you're into scifi or thrillers.
