I"Ä<p>So I finally got around to setting up a personal website about a week ago and it looked very nice (I used a template which handled the styling and the mobile compatibility), but it wasnâ€™t really what I was hoping to get out of a personal website. I sort of threw it up there as an electronic business card, but what Iâ€™m hoping for is a very casual blog that wonâ€™t require a lot (or any, preferably) maintenance.</p>

<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> is a good candidate because it is free and thereâ€™s a bunch of tutorials for getting it up and ready. I ran the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/">quickstart</a> and read some of the docs and was up and running pretty quickly. Because itâ€™s on Github Pages, you can view the public repo <a href="https://github.com/joshuaj004/joshuaj004.github.io">here</a>. There really isnâ€™t that much to it, you just create a new file and Jekyll handles all the generating of the relevant files.</p>

<p>I might decide to switch up how the blog looks and use a theme. It seems there are tons of them available, but I donâ€™t wanna spend too much time before Iâ€™m sure that Iâ€™ll stick with this blog.</p>
