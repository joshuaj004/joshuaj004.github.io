I"×<p>Hello there! There is my new blog and hopefully my new personal website. I wanted to go with this format because I have a few different topics I want to write about and keep track of. I donâ€™t have a writing cadence at the moment, but Iâ€™m picturing a new post every day or so, at least until I run out of ideas.</p>

<p>I have a few ideas at the moment including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Setting up this blog</li>
  <li>My experience with Jekyll as someone who hasnâ€™t used Ruby</li>
  <li>How I learned to cook</li>
  <li>Setting up a DigitalOcean Droplet + learning some of the ins and outs of managing a server</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™ll be more, but for now Iâ€™ve gotta make sure I can make this page go live!</p>
