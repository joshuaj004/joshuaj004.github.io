I"á<p>I figured it was about time to create a personal website. Iâ€™m hoping thisâ€™ll serve as a good way to document some of the stuff I learn, as well as give me a place to write about whatever I find interesting.</p>

<p>A little about me, my name is Josh and Iâ€™m a software engineer by trade. Outside of work, I still program, but I also do other things.</p>

<p>Below Iâ€™ll list some of the stuff interesting to me:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I bought a kindle and borrow books from my library through <a href="https://libbyapp.com/welcome">Libby</a> which is a constant source of free entertainment.
    <ul>
      <li>I mostly read fiction, Iâ€™m a huge Wheel of Time fan and Iâ€™ve been on a Stephen King kick recently, but I occasionally read non-fiction if it sounds interesting to me.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I travel a lot and have lived outside of the US almost my entire life. Iâ€™m hoping to visit all 7 continents at some point (2 to go!).</li>
  <li>I love learning languages, I have a pretty good grasp on English, taught myself German (then studied abroad to practice it), and I have a vague understanding of Spanish and French. I want to get better at Maltese, but I havenâ€™t made a concerted effort just yet (soon though!).</li>
  <li>Iâ€™ve recently gotten better at cooking, Iâ€™ll create a blog post about some of the resources I use!</li>
  <li>Iâ€™m going to practice the guitar so that I can say, â€œYeah I play guitarâ€. Iâ€™ll think of a better reason at some pointâ€¦</li>
</ul>
