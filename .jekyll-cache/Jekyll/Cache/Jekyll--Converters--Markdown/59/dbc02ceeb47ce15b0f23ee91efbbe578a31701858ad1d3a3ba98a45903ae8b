I"B<p>Hello there! There is my new blog and hopefully my new personal website. I wanted to go with this format because I have a few different topics I want to write about and keep track of. I don’t have a writing cadence at the moment, but I’m picturing a new post every day or so, at least until I run out of ideas.</p>
