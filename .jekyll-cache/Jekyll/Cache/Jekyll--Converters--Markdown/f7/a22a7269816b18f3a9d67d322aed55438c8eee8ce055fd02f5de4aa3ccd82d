I"©<p>So I finally got around to setting up a personal website about a week ago and it looked very nice (I used a template which handled the styling and the mobile compatibility), but it wasnâ€™t really what I was hoping to get out of a personal website. I sort of threw it up there as an electronic business card, but what Iâ€™m hoping for is a very casual blog that wonâ€™t require a lot (or any, preferably) maintenance.</p>
