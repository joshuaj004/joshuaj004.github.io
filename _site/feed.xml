This comes with some risks because people (or bots, whatever…) will immediately start trying to log in and take control of your server. I was curious as to how many people would be trying to login and from where, so I wrote a simple and inelegant bash script to show me.&lt;/p&gt;

There is my new blog and hopefully my new personal website. I wanted to go with this format because I have a few different topics I want to write about and keep track of. I don’t have a writing cadence at the moment, but I’m picturing a new post every day or so, at least until I run out of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a few ideas at the moment including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setting up this blog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My experience with Jekyll as someone who hasn’t used Ruby&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How I learned to cook&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setting up a DigitalOcean Droplet + learning some of the ins and outs of managing a server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure there’ll be more, but for now I’ve gotta make sure I can make this page go live!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">Hello there!

I sort of threw it up there as an electronic business card, but what I’m hoping for is a very casual blog that won’t require a lot (or any, preferably) maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt; is a good candidate because it is free and there’s a bunch of tutorials for getting it up and ready. I ran the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/&quot;&gt;quickstart&lt;/a&gt; and read some of the docs and was up and running pretty quickly. Because it’s on Github Pages, you can view the public repo &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joshuaj004/joshuaj004.github.io&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. There really isn’t that much to it, you just create a new file and Jekyll handles all the generating of the relevant files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;future-work&quot;&gt;Future Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might decide to switch up how the blog looks and use a theme. It seems there are tons of them available, but I don’t wanna spend too much time before I’m sure that I’ll stick with this blog.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="blog" /><category term="github-pages" /><summary type="html">So I finally got around to setting up a personal website about a week ago and it looked very nice (I used a template which handled the styling and the mobile compatibility), but it wasn’t really what I was hoping to get out of a personal website.

I’ve already used up my AWS Free Tier credits (doing who knows what years ago), but Digital Ocean is running a promo offering $100 credits over 60 days so I signed up for that. A droplet at the smallest tier only costs $5/month so I’ll have to find some way to use up the other $90 worth of credits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital Ocean has a nice wizard to guide you through the set up and they even send a follow up email that lists some of the best practices which I thought was neat.&lt;/p&gt;
