I figured it was about time to create a personal website. I'm hoping this'll serve as a good way to document some of the stuff I learn, as well as give me a place to write about whatever I find interesting.

A little about me, my name is Josh and I'm a software engineer by trade. Outside of work, I still program, but I also do other things. 

Below I'll list some of the stuff interesting to me:
- I bought a kindle and borrow books from my library through [Libby](https://libbyapp.com/welcome) which is a constant source of free entertainment.
    - I mostly read fiction, I'm a huge Wheel of Time fan and I've been on a Stephen King kick recently, but I occasionally read non-fiction if it sounds interesting to me.
- I travel a lot and have lived outside of the US almost my entire life. I'm hoping to visit all 7 continents at some point (2 to go!).
- I love learning languages, I have a pretty good grasp on English, taught myself German (then studied abroad to practice it), and I have a vague understanding of Spanish and French. I want to get better at Maltese, but I haven't made a concerted effort just yet (soon though!).
- I've recently gotten better at cooking, I'll create a blog post about some of the resources I use!
- I'm going to practice the guitar so that I can say, "Yeah I play guitar". I'll think of a better reason at some point...
