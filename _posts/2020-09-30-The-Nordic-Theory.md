The Nordic Theory of Everything: In Search of a Better Life is a book by Anu Partanen, a dual Finnish and American citizen, that compares the various systems in the US and Finland. One of the main ideas in this book is "The Nordic Theory of Love" which is based on the Swedish Theory of Love coined by Lars Trägårdh. "The core idea is that authentic love and friendship are possible only between individuals who are independent and equal". "A person who must depend on his or her fellow citizens is, like it or not, put in a position of being subservient". She gives a few examples in the book to illustrate this:

* Grown adults with regards to their (aging) parents.

* Adult children off to college and their parents. In the US, there is this completely bonkers system where your financial aid is determined by your parents income. But what if they're not gonna pay for your college? Well buddy, you're SOL. It's backwards and creates a power dynamic. In my case, I ended up with $20,000+ dollars in loans because the government was expecting my parents to pay for my education and they didn't. 

There's more to this book than the Nordic Theory of Love, but it plays a pretty big role. Anu also talks about healthcare, health insurance, childcare, schooling, and taxes. All of these are covered relatively in depth and with each chapter all I could think was, "That makes perfect sense, why don't we do that here?" 

Here are a few questions by topic.

### Healthcare

* Why do so many Americans end up bankrupt from healthcare?
* Why isn't there a set price for the exact same procedure?
* Why is the markup on drugs and procedures so insane?
* Why is finding a good doctor that accepts new patients and your insurance so difficult?

### Health Insurance

* Why is it so expensive?
* Why is it so bad?
* Why do Americans spend the most out of any other country?
* Why is there a maximum?

### Childcare

* Why is it so expensive?

### Schooling

* Why do we spend so much for mediocre results?
* Why do we keep hiring administrators?
* Why is funding tied to property taxes?
* Why is there so much standardized testing?
* Why isn't being a teacher a respected position?
* Why aren't we making sure that improving public schools are at the forefront of every political debate?

### Taxes

Let's compare $100,000 in NYC to $100,000 (~85,000 €) in Finland. Income tax is pretty close, $32,000 vs $36,000. Finland would put around $5,000 into a pension, which is about comparable to maxing out an IRA ($6,000 in 2020). Lastly, Finland would deduct around $500/month from your paycheck for unemployment insurance. The end paycheck is a lot closer than people would believe. Not having your health insurance tied to employment or not having to worry about getting blindsided by potential medical costs is a huge positive. This is all napkin math so feel free to do your own research.

Stupidly, I looked up some reviews for this book and while I might agree that Anu was a little long winded at times, I'm not convinced that most of these low reviews have actually read the book. I think some of them read the dust jacket and saw that she said that the US wasn't #1 and lost their minds. Some reviews called it shallow, which could be a legitimate criticism. I'm of the opinion that a lot of books will appeal to a broad demographic by giving overviews, but I'm inclined to take Anu's side here. If she'd make specific comparisons with every state/locality, this book would've been another report that nobody read. If she'd make specific comparisons to a few localities, people would've said, "BUT THIS DOESN'T APPLY TO _MY_ VILLAGE". All in all, I read too many reviews.

Reading this book made me want to either visit, study or live in Finland and I'm not sure which just yet. I'll live this handy link right [here](https://migri.fi/en/finnish-citizenship).
