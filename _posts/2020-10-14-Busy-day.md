The day is barely halfway through and already it's been a busy day. It's been raining the last 2 days and my shoes don't have the best grip so I decided I wasn't going to risk slipping and injuring myself. However today was nice and sunny so I did something approximating a jog. I partially planned a hike which involved coordinating people, finding a place to hike, finding transportation so on and so forth. I learned how to restring a guitar cause one of the strings (the D string if you're curious) snapped. I'd never done this before so it isn't pretty, but it does work! I was able to tune it and I watched a video on how to play Coldplay's Viva la Vida. I can't quite do it, but maybe I'll practice some more and be able to do it one day. My chair's armrests were bumping into the guitar so I popped those off. 

I was originally going to add a section about the MVP for selling stuff online, but it was getting really long, so I'll split that into a different post.
