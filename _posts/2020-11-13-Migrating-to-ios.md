It turns out that migrating phones is a huge pain. The Move to iOS app is absolutely terrible for many reasons:
- It has trouble connecting to the old phone, just use bluetooth or nfc or something.
- It relies on a direct wifi transfer. It sets up a hotspot and connects the other phone over this terrible wifi.
- You can only transfer on a new phone. If you click past this and set it up later, then you missed your chance. You have to reset the phone to try again.

There's a few other things that suck, but I don't really feel like typing them up b/c I'm too busy migrating it over. Hopefully iOS is more fun after it's set up.
