Everyone knows what the dictionary definition for a millionaire is, roughly, an individual whose net worth >= 1 million of some currency. Of course, culturally a millionaire means someone who can buy whatever they want. As time marches on, so does inflation so a millionaire from 1920 had a greater ability to acquire whatever they want versus a millionaire from 2020. For the curious, $1,000,000 in 1920 is worth $12,995,900 in 2020 ([Link](https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1920?amount=1000000)), but $12-almost-13-aire doesn't really have the same ring to it. Anyways, I thought I'd type up this post to see some of the methods to becoming a millionaire.

## Some Methods and Their Reproducibility 

| Method | Major Factors | Reproducibility |
|-|-|-|
| Be born in a rich family and receive a sizeable inheritance | Pure luck | Can't really do much to cause this except get adopted. |
| Win the lottery | Luck (with the occasional mathematician winning when the odds are good enough) | Theoretically anyone can buy a lotto ticket, but sometimes you see large amounts of money being pooled together to increase the odds of that pool winning.  |
| Work at a(n acquired) start up | Luck | You have to get lucky joining a lucky start up early enough for your stocks to mean anything. I'm not convinced that choosing the start up is more anything but luck. |
| Investing in index funds | Patience | Anyone who can sock away $6,000/year (maxing out your IRA) can become a millionaire in under 40 years assuming 7% returns. This makes it a great option, but it will take a while. |
| Create a SaaS startup? | ??? | ??? |


I don't think the first 3 are really a surprise to anyone and the math is pretty simple on the 4th method, but I want to chart out what you'd need to become a millionaire with SaaS (software as a Service or basically a subscription based model). 

## SaaS -> Millionaire

| Price per Month | Number of Months | Number of Customers | Total | Effort for Each Sale | Comments |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| 1,000,000 | 1 | 1 | 1,000,000 | Astronomical | It really isn't unheard of to sell software for upwards of a million dollars, but my guess is you need to be a subject matter expert to build something useful and have the right connections to even discuss a sale.  Think of this as building something for a specific company either better than or before anything other company in the industry has it. |
| 100,000 | 1 | 10 | 1,000,000 | Very High | If you're selling something to a few major players in the industry, you should be able to get your 10 customers. Maybe it'll be easier to make additional sales once you get the first company to bite. |
| 10,000 | 1 | 100 | 1,000,000 | High | At this price point, you've made your software accessible to a surprisingly large audience. $10,000 sounds like a lot of money, but it's less than some companies spend on a single trade show booth and there are a lot of companies with that money. 100 customers is even a small enough number that you could personally broker these sales. |
| 1,000 | 1 | 1,000 | 1,000,000 | Medium | $1,000 is basically a cheap piece of equipment for a lot of businesses. Browse any domain specific supply store (e.g. a restaurant supply store) and look at how much some of the equipment costs. Some of the equipment for small businesses is in the high 5 figure range. At this point, you should have an automated sale/onboarding process that requires absolutely no human intervention. Customer support is  a different matter, but you want to be able to get a new customer 24/7/365. |
| 100 | 1 | 10,000 | 1,000,000 | Low | Your software will likely be extraordinarily generic spanning many industries. At the price point of $100 you'll be in the range of marketing directly to consumers as well. Maybe your product is the most innovative scheduling program yet and businesses and consumers alike can't get enough. |
| 100 | 10 | 1,000 | 1,000,000 | Low | According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2018 the average American was spending $99/month on their cell phone bill! You just need to make sure your service is providing what, in your consumers mind, is approximately the same value as their cell phone plan. The key is specificity, find a niche where the participants have some extra cash they wouldn't mind spending on a better product. Maybe you target swim coaches and sell them a better way to organize swim meets or something. |
| 10 | 10 | 10,000 | 1,000,000 | Very Low | At $10/month, your product should almost be an impulse purchase for customers. $10 is the cost of a couple of coffees or a Chipotle burrito, $10/month is not even thought of for most consumers. Think about all the monthly bills you have and how much you're paying for them, e.g. Spotify $10/Month, Netflix $13/month for HD, MyFitnessPal $10/month so on and so forth. You only need people to subscribe for 10 months so this could even capitalize on a fad e.g. Acai Bowl Locator, but ideally you'd want something that will continue to be useful to your customers |
| 1 | 10 | 100,000 | 1,000,000 | Very Low | I'm not sure what product even makes sense at this price point, maybe an app or some sort of game? I think that the vast majority of people willing to pay $1/month would also be willing to pay $10/month and pricing something this low is leaving money on the table. That being said, the US has over 300 cities with a population of 100,000 people or more so maybe you can develop something for a specific town and either directly (by having citizens purchase from you) or indirectly (by having the city government purchase from you on behalf of the citizens). I'd really have to think about this more in depth. |

Note: When number of months is 1, that just denotes a 1 time sale. Not only are these sales usually higher effort, but they don't generate recurring income. In other words, a $100 single shot customer is going to net you less money than a $10/month customer as long as they remain subscribed for over 10 months.

I personally think the sweet spot is $10/month @ 10,000 customers. It won't be effortless to get there, but I think it's very achievable.

Well I have a picnic to get to, so that concludes this post.
