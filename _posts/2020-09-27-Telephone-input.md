I was testing out my sudoku board on my phone and I realized that the input type I was using (number) was giving me a different keyboard than I expected. It turns out that most number input fields actually use an input type of Tel, which makes punching in numbers easier. See [this article](https://uxcellence.com/2014/html5-input-types) for a visual. A quick fix (less than a minute) for a pretty decent quality of life improvement.
