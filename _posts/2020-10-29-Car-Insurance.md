I don't know how many fliers for car insurance and pre approved car loans that I've received, but it's easily in the double digits. That doesn't even include the emails, which was probably in the hundreds before I aggressively started marking things as spam. Anyways, these letters typically cost these companies around 50c each, so they've spent at least $5 trying to sell car insurance to someone who doesn't own a car. I'm honestly not sure where I'm going with this post, there are a couple of topics here:
* The inefficiency of mailers
* What a waste mailing people stuff is, both financially and environmentally
* How expensive owning a car is

I guess I'll write a few sentences on each...

## The inefficiency of mailers and how bad it is financially and environmentally
One of the things I was surprised to learn was just how low the response rate was for mailers. It's less than 1%. Wayyyy less. It's so low that I didn't think it was worth mailing these stupid things out, but apparently the math checks out. It shouldn't though. Most of these mailers go straight to the trash bin -- not even the recycling bin. They're just junk going straight to our landfills for what purpose? Every time I've signed up for something, e.g. a credit card or rental insurance, it hasn't been because of a mailer. I understand that not everyone is like that, but maybe some time should be invested in doing the bare minimum of investigation to see if the person you're trying to sell auto insurance to even has a car. 

## How Expensive Owning a Car Is
I'm digging through the [Consumer Expenditure Surveys from the Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/cex/tables.htm#avgexp) and if I'm reading it correctly, there are some really surprising numbers. The survey is split by consumer units, each of which contains 2.5 people, with 1.3 earners and 1.9 vehicles. Right off the bat, there are more vehicles than earners. It's a common pattern, one vehicle for the earner to drive to work and another vehicle to ferry children around to various activities, but maybe a pattern that shouldn't be as automatic as it is. Almost 90% of these consumer units owned at least 1 vehicle. The mean annual spend on transportation is $10,742 which makes up purchasing a car (new or used), buying gasoline and motor oil, other vehicle expenses (including vehicle finance charges, maintenance and repairs, leases licensing etc), and public transit. 

* Since I'm focusing on cars, I'll subtract the $781 from the total. 
* Vehicle purchasing accounts for $4,394 so I'm assuming they calculate this by taking the total price of a car and amortizing the cost over the ownership lifetime, e.g. if you buy a $30,000 car, you're expected to hold onto it for about 7 years which sounds right to be, but I am _really_ disconnected from this world so I may be wrong.
* Gasoline and other fuels account for $2,094
* Other vehicle expenses is another $4,374 (this is where insurance and repairs are categorized)

That comes out to $9,962/year spent on car related expenses. That's pretty insane! When I had an unlimited MTA card, my yearly expense for transportation was about $1,500 but it's important to note that this was pre-tax money, which you can't really use for most car expenses (correct me if I'm wrong though!). If you use the PATH, you could drop that cost to $1,272 with an unlimited PATH card or even $600/year if you work from home frequently enough. If you can ditch your car, you could be spending 16x less on transportation! Anytime you wanted to escape to the mountains or something like that you could rent a car for those weekends and still come out way ahead. 

I think the takeaway is this:
* Push for better public transit. It'll save you money (personal benefit) and pay for itself many times over for the workforce (e.g. you can now get to work without a car, potentially saving thousands)
* Heavily factor availability of public transit when considering new housing/jobs/cities.
