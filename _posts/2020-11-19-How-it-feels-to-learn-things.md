Learning as a concept is weird. There are a few stages of knowing something, I'll give you an example from today. I was eating some leftover fusilli pasta and I thought about how they looked like those things on power pylons (see hastily made diagram below).

Before this moment I didn't know what those things were called and while on some level I didn't know what they were called, it definitely wasn't an active thought. Then, I knew that I didn't know what they were called. Sometimes I don't look these things up and I continue my life until I'm remember that I don't know that and then I'm at this crossroads again. In this case today I decided I'd find out. I'd heard about this tip the other day and was excited to put it into action. If you know the general name of something, you should search [that] + diagram on your favorite search engine's images tab. In my case, I searched "power pylon diagram" and clicked through the images until I found one that showed what I now know are insulators. From there you can search "power pylon insulator diagram" to confirm that you're able to read diagrams and you're off to the races. I used [this link](https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/5710753) and then I found [this post](https://www.electricaleasy.com/2016/10/insulators-used-in-overhead-power-lines.html) about the types of insulators used in overhead powerlines. And following the links in that post, you find [this post](https://www.electricaleasy.com/2016/11/electrical-insulators.html) with even more types of insulators. The second post was published in November versus October, so while it took Kiran Daware a month to gather this additional information, I was able to get it within minutes of opening their page. Way to pass it on, Kiran! 

Anyways, it felt pretty cool to put a name to the 'face' of those insulators. Now I have this knowledge that yesterday I wasn't conscious I lacked. I'm sure tomorrow I'll learn something that will have me shaking my head in the ignorance of today-me, but that's the circle of life.
