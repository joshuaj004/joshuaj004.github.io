I followed the basic tutorial at [https://dockerswarm.rocks/](https://dockerswarm.rocks/) which involved creating a second droplet. I also created a docker account, but was unable to push my local docker images up there. It was a really nice day outside, so sue me for not getting a whole lot done :P
