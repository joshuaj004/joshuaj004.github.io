Happy Halloween! It is officially the spookiest day of the year! I went to spirit halloween and target for some last minute decorations and it was stripped bare. I read that most of these Spirit Halloweens only do 2 month leases and make as much money as other stores make in 12 months and now I kinda believe it. I guess it's good that there wasn't a whole lot because then I didn't have to buy things that would sit in my closet 99% of the year. Anyways, this year I probably won't see any trick-or-treaters :'( but it's for the best. Have a fun (and safe) Halloween!
