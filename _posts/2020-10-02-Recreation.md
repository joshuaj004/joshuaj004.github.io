Self improvement comes in many forms: physically, intellectually, culturally, so on and so forth. I'll be the first to admit that exercising was one of the things that I didn't keep up over the pandemic. Prior to covid, I was getting around 10,000 or something like 5 miles of walking per day. From March onwards there were many days when I didn't leave the house and pacing around my apartment can only be done so many times. In August and September, I decided I wanted to make an effort to be more active and I go outside easily 9/10 days. However, it's mostly walking, which while still an improvement, doesn't really get the blood pumping. I sold my bike earlier this year because it wasn't the right one for me, but I've thought about getting another one. I am a bit hesitant to take it on the roads because some drivers here are hostile/straight up murderous towards bikers. 

Anyways, I decided I'd run a mile today. I haven't run in at least a year (probably longer), it waws raining, my shoes are old and lack proper traction, the boardwalk was slippery, and I'd have to hold my phone and keys because I didn't want them jingling around in my pockets. So with that in mind, I was expecting a 12 minute mile or 5 mph. The average walking speed is around a 20 minute mile or 3 mph, so I didn't think that my goal was a crazy goal. I was hoping for a 10 minute mile or 6 mph. My mile time ended up being 8m37s which I am thrilled about. 

I found [this article](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326263#average-mile-time) about the average mile time by age and gender along with the world records.

I am in the second age group which means my time of 8m37s puts me in the top 50% of men in my age group. I'm certainly not a running fanatic, but I suspect neither is most of the world. If I can maintain this mile time for the next 30 years, I'll be in the top 1% without changing a thing. However, I mentioned a bunch of factors slowing down this run so I am actually pretty confident that I can improve this time. The previously linked article recommends training, using caffeine, and improving nutrition. There is a lot I can do to improve, I don't usually drink coffee or tea, and the tea I usually have is caffeine free, and I should be eating better. Perhaps in the next week I'll look at some dedicated running shoes.

I've also started reading The Stand by Stephen King which is about a flu pandemic that kills a lot of people. I'm making pretty good progress, but it is a long book so it'll take a few days. If you're looking for another book about pandemics, I can recommend Severance by Ling Ma.
