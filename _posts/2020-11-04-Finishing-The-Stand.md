I stayed up late last night following the presidential election and reading The Stand. It was almost 2 am and I decided it would be best to go to bed, so with about a chapter left in my book I called it a night. I finished it up this morning and man what a book. It took me a while to read it because it was so long and because there were parts I couldn't bear to read. In the end, I did read it all, but parts of it are disturbing (it's about the super flu after all...). I'll probably start on The Count of Monte Cristo next, I enjoyed the movie a lot!
