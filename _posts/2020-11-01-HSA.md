I've recently become eligible for an HSA which means that I have to do some research on it. I've briefly glanced over at the investment options, but there might be a fee associated with it. Otherwise it would sit in a savings account accruing a mere 0.10% APR. I'd have to look at if I could transfer it to fidelity and invest there. If you're interested in this sort of stuff, I highly recommend reading [this post](https://www.madfientist.com/ultimate-retirement-account/). It details why contributing to an HSA makes sense even if you don't anticipate spending a lot on Medical expenses (but then again, no one really _plans_ on having medical expenses).
