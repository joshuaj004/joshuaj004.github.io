Today is just one of those days that I was reminiscing about traveling. I visited Japan for the first time last year and it quickly became one of my favorite countries. I knew maybe 3 phrases in Japanese, but luckily it wasn't an issue to navigate, check in at hostels, or order food. I've been to 5 out of the 7 continents and would love to see the rest, but COVID has put a pin in these plans. Nevertheless, it's fun to go to the [Google Flights explore page](https://www.google.com/travel/explore) and see what flights are available. It blows my mind that a flight from NYC -> Orlando is less than the cost of a cab from my apartment to the airport ($39 at the moment). The title of this post is actually stolen from a website that shows you the cost of living in cities around the world called, [The Earth Awaits](https://www.theearthawaits.com/). It gives a breakdown of the cost of housing, food, transportation, etc... It may be a while before I travel again, but it's fun to look at. For the same reason, I'll sometimes browse Zillow and look at places outside of NYC ðŸ˜…. I'll leave you with this quote about travel from Mark Twain:

"Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime."
