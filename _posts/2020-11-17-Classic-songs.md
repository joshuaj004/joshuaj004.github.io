I feel like I really missed out on a lot of classic music growing up. Not necessarily classical music, but also classic music, e.g. the bangers and bops of yesteryear. I got recommended Blondie's Heart of Glass -- which I'd never listened to before. I'd heard _of_ Blondie, but I'd never listened to hear. It's not the most incredible song I've ever listened to, but it's a fun, upbeat one. Kinda catchy too. There's definitely the foreign living that meant I missed out on a lot of American music, but my parents didn't really play music in the house or the car. The ratio of talk radio to singing radio was all out of wack. A benefit of this is that I can listen to the classics like its the first time because it is the first time. I've got a lot of catching up to do.
