The FastAPI Project Generator comes with PostgreSQL as the database and supports pgAdmin right out of the box. I admit I haven't used pgAdmin before so I imagine I'll spend the next day or two reading through the docs (in my case for pgAdmin 4). A little fun fact is that pgAdmin 4's backend is written in Python with Flask and QT framework. I don't have much to add for this as I haven't started reading yet, but hopefully I'll have some interesting tidbits for tomorrow's post.
