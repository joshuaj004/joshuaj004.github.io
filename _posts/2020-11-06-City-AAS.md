Earlier today/yesterday evening, [this link about Helsinki](https://www.helsinkibusinesshub.fi/90-day-finn/) made it to the top of HackerNews. It seems that Finland is trying to recruit a small number (15 people) of people (mostly US citizens) to work from Finland for 90 (or more (tired of parentheses yet?)). I read about the Finnish way of life in The Nordic Theory of Everything and I mused that living in Finland would be interesting, so I put my money where my mouth is (not really) and applied. This organization would handle a lot of the more bureaucratic issues with working from another country, including finding a place to live (although I don't think they pay for it), rides to and from the airport, get togethers and Finnish experiences. Either way, it sounds like the more interesting option so fingers crossed.
