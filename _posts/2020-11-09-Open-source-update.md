Last week I made a PR to the k6 repo to update some docs, [link here](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6-docs/pull/146) and I just got an update today. It seems that this rogue '$' appears over 100 times in their repo and they're considering removing all of them. There's not really much to add, maybe I'll make a post when it gets merged in :)
