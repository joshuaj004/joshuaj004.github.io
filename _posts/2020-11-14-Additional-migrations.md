As I'm trying to switch over to using my new phone, I'm discovering some more things that are more annoying than I thought they'd be:

### Backing up Whatsapp messages to move them
- It turns out that it isn't possible to move Whatsapp cross platform and retain all your messages. I've read about the sand mandalas that the Tibetan Buddhists make to symbolized the impermanence of material life, but I would still like to know that I have the option to view these messages again. It doesn't make sense to me that something that stores messages in the cloud is incompatible with a different OS.

### Finding the Apple equivalent app
- I've got a few apps that were android specific so I have to find the corresponding app on the app store. 

### Syncing calendars
- I could not figure out how to sync my google calendar with the iOS calendar and once I added a calendar I couldn't delete it. I chose to just download google calendar on my iPhone.

### Not all my contacts transferred
- While all of my _text messages_ transferred, bizarrely only about 90% of my contacts transferred. So some of my texts just have the phone number at the top and I have to read through the messages and create a new contact for someone who I've spent years talking to. 

### Signing into a lot of apps
- I had a lot of apps with logins that I have no recollection of making so I had to go through and reset my password for these and copy them over to my new phone. Hopefully a one time thing.

I'm still adjusting so I'm sure I'll sort this out soon enough, but I've literally had an easier moving to certain countries than moving from Android -> iOS.
