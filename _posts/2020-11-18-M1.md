Apple has recently released a new chip called the M1. This'll replace the Intel + AMD CPU that are the big 2 (and really the only players) in the space. Apple is making a lot of big claims about this new chip, e.g. it's faster and it uses less power which means a longer battery life. We're seeing some preliminary reports that are more or less confirming Apple's results which is very exciting. Since this new chip is ARM (instead of 32 or 64 bit), we may see better support for ARM programs which could translate against better support for systems like the raspberry pi.
