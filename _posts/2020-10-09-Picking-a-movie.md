My approach to picking movies is usually quite straight forward and includes various methods such as:
* Thinking the poster looks cool
* Seeing the movie in another movie (like Count of Monte Cristo in V for Vendetta)
* If it's listed in a "Movies you probably missed" type post
* Word of mouth 
* Similar movie section on something like IMDB 

I personally like to go in without watching trailers or anything like that. I've got a few actors who movies I usually avoid (like jake gyllenhaal), so unless a film contains those actors, it's usually fine to watch. Of course, this is for movies I pick as an individual which makes it easy enough. As soon as you add more people to movie night, you've gotta consider what draws them to movies and if they have things that make a movie a 'no watch'. I wonder if you could build out a recommendation engine that recommends movies to you and then also recommends movies that multiple people will likely judge as acceptable to watch. You'd probably want an actor block list, a genre preference, a length preference, maybe a ratings preference? It would be an interesting thing to work on.
