I'm thinking it makes sense to create a daily puzzle (probably using the date as a seed) and an email to let people see the daily puzzle. What I would have to do to enable this:

* Create a new routed page to accept the parameters
* Allow people to add their emails
* Send out a link to the new sudoku page

Today is kind of a busy day, so I'm really just writing a short outline. I'll probably get started on it tomorrow tho!
