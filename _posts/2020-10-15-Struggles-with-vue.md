Yesterday I said I was hoping I could make some progress and that I hadn't decided if they were going to be frontend or backend changes. This morning I decided I'd try to make some improvements to the front end, but I ran into a few issues:
- Vue's Router (especially the children) wasn't working
- I couldn't `console.log` for a few hours (I'm still not sure why, but a restart of my computer fixed it)
- I'm running into an issue with the actions and the state

Nothing insurmountable, but their powers combined are enough to make sure I didn't make much progress ;)
