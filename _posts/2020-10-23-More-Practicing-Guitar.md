Continuing with my guitar practice, I'm definitely feeling like I've improved. I didn't have to consult the chord charts after the first minute or so and the sounds emanating from my guitar sound vaguely musical. I'm able to switch chords faster and I'm able to do them best in this order: G -> Em, Em -> C, C -> D, D -> G. I've also got the strum pattern down! Of course, there's a palm muted pattern to learn which looks a bit trickier, but I'm up to the challenge.
