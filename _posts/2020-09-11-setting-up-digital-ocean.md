I will be starting the [Linux Up Skill Challenge](https://github.com/snori74/linuxupskillchallenge) which I hope will make me more comfortable with managing a server. I've already used up my AWS Free Tier credits (doing who knows what years ago), but Digital Ocean is running a promo offering $100 credits over 60 days so I signed up for that. A droplet at the smallest tier only costs $5/month so I'll have to find some way to use up the other $90 worth of credits. 

Digital Ocean has a nice wizard to guide you through the set up and they even send a follow up email that lists some of the best practices which I thought was neat.

I also learned how to add images with this post which was cool ðŸ˜Ž
