One of my favorite websites is [Engaging Data](https://engaging-data.com/). It's got a bunch of interactive charts and such that I find interesting. Of note are a few:

- https://engaging-data.com/avoidable-us-coronavirus-deaths/
- https://engaging-data.com/fire-calculator/
- https://engaging-data.com/will-money-last-retire-early/
- https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/
- https://engaging-data.com/antipodes-map/

There's a decent amount of financial ones (which I always find interesting), one about corona, and one to see where you'd end up if you dug a hole to the center of the earth. There's a lot more on there so I highly recommend checking it out!
