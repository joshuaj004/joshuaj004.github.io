I went hiking today and boy am I tired. It was a little over an hour drive, but the parking lot was full so we had to find an overflow lot which was pretty far away. Then there wasn't a marked trail so there was a decent amount of wandering. The leaves were beautiful and it was really nice to get out into nature. Afterwards we found a clutch Mexican restaurant which served chimichangas. A long day, but a good one.
