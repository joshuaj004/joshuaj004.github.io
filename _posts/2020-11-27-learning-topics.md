I always thought that I would naturally pick some things up as I got older, but the rate of passive learning is at least 100x slower than active learning based on my totally made up estimates. I'm taking passive learning to mean something along the lines of, "I didn't seek out this information." Examples of this would include somebody telling you something or hearing something on the radio. I'm defining active learning as having curiosity about a topic and specifically searching out more information on it. As I'm writing this, 100x slower sounds pretty conservative, but it was a made up number anyways. There's a few things I'd want to learn:

- Identifying components of the natural world. I'm not well practiced with identifying plants or animals or rocks + minerals and I'm sure I'm not alone in this. Usually, I'd check Khan Academy, but unforunately they don't have any plant identification videos. Funnily enough, I've worked on the website of one the top results when you search for a plant identification class online, but I've never worked through the course. I know that if you volunteer to clean up parks, sometimes you'll learn a new plant or two, but it's not the most efficient way. I could enroll in a class, but that would be a little pricey and I'd have to work it into my schedule. I've found [this old video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93gjF1lRhDw) on Youtube that might be useful (and best of all, it's free!) 

- A better sense of the countries around the world. While I am able to identify and place most countries, it's only because I spent about a week last year playing the [Countries of the World Quiz on Sporcle](https://www.sporcle.com/games/g/world). That is nice, but I think it would be really cool to learn their flags and capitals and perhaps some of their traditional cuisine. I am very lucky to live in an international city and some people really light up if you can connect with them about where they're from. I know that I'm like that :)

- A better appreciation for the classics. There's a lot of classical reading that I've missed out on, I've never read Beowulf or The Great Gatsby or most of Shakespeare. I know I could sit down and force myself to power through, but that isn't the mindset I want going into it. I always picture it as having a paper copy that I can mark up with notes (which is weird, because I usually hate marking up books, it's almost sacrilege to me. That's a whole other discussion and I can see both sides of it.)

- Better understanding of philosophy. Sometimes I read a quote and that quote alone makes me want to read the rest of the work to be able to better understand it. SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard has some really great quotes and I know that I should read his works. 

It looks like I've typed up my New Year's Resolutions a month early huh? Of course identifying what you want to do is only the first step, you've also got to act on it.
