I signed up for mailchimp because I wanted to programmatically send emails, but I don't think that's really what mailchimp is for. From doing a little more research, I think that Sendgrid is more in line with what I want. It's owned by Twilio (which I sometimes use to programmatically send texts) and I've never run into an issue with them. Sendgrid also has a free tier which is 40,000 emails for the first 30 days and then 100 emails/day forever. It'll be a while before I hit that limit, but then it'll be $15/month for 50,000 emails/month which is _so much mail_. So far I've verified a single sender (in my case admin@joshj.xyz) as well as my domain which should make the sent emails look nicer. I'm currently running into some issues with importing the sendgrid library otherwise I'd have a nice screenshot below. I'll try again tomorrow!
