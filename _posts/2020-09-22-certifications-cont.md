I went through the rest of the site and all the monitoring is deployed, which is great. It's also great that each of these URLs has a valid SSL certificate from Lets Encrypt. What's not great is that the actual meat and potatoes does not. I think I might just regenerate the project from scratch and see if that solves it.
