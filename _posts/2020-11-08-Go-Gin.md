Earlier this week, I wrote about trying out some Golang and how my initial impression was that it was _fast_. I wanted to quantify that so that I decided I'd compare [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) a Go HTTP Web Framework with Python's FastAPI. I didn't want to rewrite the whole sudoku service in Go, so I just ported over the dummy sudoku board endpoint. All this does is return the same sudoku board json object, not a whole lot of computation done. This is what the code looks like:

```Go
package main

import "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"

func main() {
	r := gin.Default()
	r.GET("/dummyboard", func(c *gin.Context) {
		arr := [9][9]int{
			{0, 0, 7, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0},
			{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 6},
			{0, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0},
			{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 7, 0},
			{0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0},
			{0, 0, 8, 7, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0},
			{3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0},
			{0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0},
		}
		c.JSON(200, gin.H{
			"board":      arr,
			"seed":       1,
			"difficulty": 0.5,
		})
	})
	r.Run() // listen and serve on 0.0.0.0:8080 (for windows "localhost:8080")
}
```

It looks basically the same as the Python code, you can check that code at [this previous blog post](https://joshuaj004.github.io/performance-testing/k6/2020/09/17/performance-testing-with-k6.html). I'll be performance testing with [K6](https://k6.io/) again.

This is the Python performance with 1, 10, and 100 virtual users:

Versus Go Gin's performance with 1, 10, and 100 virtual users:

As you can see, Go absolutely blows Python out of the water. 

With 1 virtual user, Go is about 10x faster.

With 10 virtual users, Go is about 21x faster.

With 100 virtual users, Go is about 17x faster.

Even with 100 virtual users, Go is not sweating, with an average duration time of only 4.63 milliseconds. That is incredible! Just for kicks, I tried it out with 1000 virtual users and the performance is about 52 milliseconds which is still very, very good.
