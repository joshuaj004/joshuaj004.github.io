I've been meaning to write this post, or something like it, for a while. It is one of the things that I am quite passionate about so I often get requests on my advice for it. Instead of typing something up each time, I would like to be able to send this post out. Without further ado, here we go.

## Initial Thoughts
I have no idea where the belief that you can't learn a new language after age 9/12/15/18 came about, but it's pervasive! Personally, I think it's because it allows people to have an easy out, "Oh I couldn't learn a new language, I'm too old, I missed the cut off." That's a bad reason not to learn a new language. Even, "I don't wanna" is a better reason because at least that reason is grounded in reality. 

As someone who learned languages as both a kid and a non-kid, there's no magic that comes from being a kid other than having an enormous amount of time. Sometimes I'll hear that kids have nothing to be afraid because they can be wrong without being made fun of. 99% of native speakers will be absolutely thrilled that you are trying to learn their language and while you may get corrected, you probably won't get bullied for a simple mistake. Even if you do get bullied, you don't have to talk to that person, just insult them and walk away ;)

My end goal for learning a language isn't necessarily to say that I'm fluent in it, but rather to be confident in my ability to accomplish most tasks I think I'll need. I want to be able to order off of a menu, I want to be able to get directions, I want to be able to check in to a hotel, I want to be able to see a movie or tv show and understand the gist of it. If you want to be 100% fluent with no accent, maybe this isn't the most optimal method, but there's nothing stopping you from learning this way and then continuing on further. 

## How Many Hours will this Take?
There are a bunch of people trying to sell you methods that will make you fluent in a week, but these are all bullshit. There's really no other way to put it, how can you expect to learn Arabic in under a week? If there was a method that allowed this, don't you think the military or some language academy would be shouting it from the rooftops. We wouldn't have a shortage of translators if that was the case. 

I've generally found the Foreign Service Institute's timelines for a student to reach "Professional Working Proficiency" to be accurate, although there are a number of factors that can cause this to vary. Languages are split up into different categories and each category has an approximate number of hours associated with it. I'll screenshot an image below.

You'll notice that this is not a 1 week course, it is a pretty big commitment. These 'x' weeks assumes you're getting 25 hours of instruction a week. You have to be very self motivated to do this. How many people dedicate 25 hours a week to anything in their life? Is it possible -- yes. Think of it this way, you have (work, a social life, and a commitment to language learning), but you can only pick 2. The best option is obviously the social life and the language learning, but the most realistic is work and language learning. Another answer is to move abroad so that you can combine your social life and language learning while still working, but that is a bit harder to coordinate. I've sort of done all 3 and working a full time job and language learning is by far the most intense, but it is doable. 

These hours look like a lot and they are a lot, but I'll show you that you can hit these numbers. I would recommend tracking your hours in a spreadsheet so that you can get an approximation for easy reference. 

## Audio First Approach
I can't claim to have thought of this, but from all the methods I've used, this one is the clear winner. All this means is that instead of trying to learn a language by reading or writing, you learn by listening and speaking. I'm sure somebody will chime in saying, "I'm a visual learner" or something like that, but ignore them. Think back to how you learned your first language, was a book set in front of you or were you constantly talked to? 

## What Resources to Use for this Approach
### Learn the Sounds of the Language
Look up the alphabet or a pronunciation guide (preferable with audio) and just listen to all the sounds. When you've done that, make the sounds along with them. This simple activity will pay enormous dividends. I struggled with some of the sounds in German, but practicing them meant I was able to sound like someone who had been studying the language a lot longer than I actually had.

### Language Transfer
[Language Transfer](https://www.languagetransfer.org/home) is by far the best resource I've used in my life for language learning. There is no catch, it is 100% free and there is no reason not to use it (other than if they don't have the language you're trying to learn haha). Currently they have French, Swahili, Italian, Greek, German, Turkish, Arabic, and Spanish. These courses go to different levels, but all of them at least encompass the Intro to [that language]. For the German course, it took me about 17 hours to work through the course and you will be surprised by just how much you can say after the course. Language Transfer teaches the framework of a language so as you learn more vocab, you're able to slide it into this mental model and use it easily.

### Michel Thomas
People on the internet are pretty split on Michel Thomas, but I liked his German course. It does cost money, sometimes he gets noticeably frustrated with his students, and it feels a little bit dated, but it does the audio first approach well. You can also find the courses on youtube if you're a bit stingy ;)

### Radio
Find a news radio in your target language and just listen to it. Don't worry about not understanding it, at this point you're just trying to get used to the sound of the language. For German, I used [Deutchslandradio](https://srv.deutschlandradio.de/themes/dradio/script/aod/index.html?audioMode=2&audioID=4&state=) which was available as a website and as an app. The website actually tells you how long you've been listening to it for. Occasionally, you'll hear a word that sticks in your mind and then you should look it up. For me, one of those words was, "Allerdings". Count these hours in your spreadsheet! Even if you're not paying 100% of your attention to the radio, I think there is something to be said for learning by osmosis.

### TV Shows and Movies
This is a fun way to get some hours. I recommend finding material with audio in your target language and subtitles in your native language (if you need/want them). I got an insane amount of hours from this and it feels easier than sitting down and studying. Netflix will let you search by available audio and I'm sure the other streaming sites do as well.

### Find a Speaker
There are a lot of language exchange programs where you find a native speaker and talk to them in their language and they talk to you in your language. I haven't used apps for this, but I know they exist. You can also use something like [italki](https://www.italki.com/) to find a teacher. The prices aren't bad, usually under $30/hour. I haven't used it, but it seems like a good resource. 

## Reading and Writing
At this point, I have approximately 240 hours of German under my belt and I decided it was probably time I started expanding my approach and enrolled in 2 introductory German classes, each of them an hour a day, 5 days a week. The homework was usually about an hour a day total, so I was getting 15 hours a week in addition to my extracurricular activities. My University also hosted 'Kaffeestunde' literally Coffee Hour where they provided a space to chat in German and enjoy coffee and German food. If they offer this, go to it! It's free and you get practice with speakers at and above your current level. 

## Vocab
Use something like [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) or [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/) to learn new vocab. It handles the spaced repetition so you are able to learn and remember the vocab. Anki has a huge userbase, so you can search for 'Decks' for your target language and import them. Memrise has the same thing, try them both. Anki is Free as in beer and Memrise will probably try to convince you to buy the pro version of something like that, but you can use it for free. 

## Immerse Yourself
After preparing for a few months, I participated in a study abroad in Vienna which was some of the best months of my life (so far at least ;) ). In addition to practicing German every day for everything, I was also enrolled in a daily 3 hour intensive class. This included speaking, reading, and writing. I ended up with a B2 certificate in German after less than a year of studying. German is a Category 2 language which the FSI says will take approximately 36 weeks so that lines up with what I did.

## Final Thoughts

This post is getting pretty long (wc is telling me it's almost 1700 words) so I'll wrap this one up. It is absolutely possible to learn a language at any point in your life. It will be a big commitment, but it will be **SO** worth it. If you have any specific questions, please write to me (email is in the footer) I will be overjoyed to help in any way that I can :)
