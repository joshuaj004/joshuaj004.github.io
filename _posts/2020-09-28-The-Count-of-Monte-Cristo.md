Yesterday I watched [The Count of Monte Cristo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245844/) for the first time. I hadn't read the book or seen any of the previous movies so everything was new to me. According to IMDB trivia, this is the 17th adaption of the book and was apparently one of Mark Twain's favorite books. I can see why, I really enjoyed the film, although I imagine a few liberties were taken to appeal to a modern audience. One of the most surprising things (to me at least) was that it was filmed in Malta. Apparently the Grand Harbour looks similar to how Marseille looked in the 19th century. If you're watching carefully you can see some traditional Maltese boats in the harbor of Marseille (filmed in Valletta, Malta). The Azure Window (of Gozo) makes an appearance which is no longer possible (unfortunately it collapsed in early 2017). The movie itself was a lot of fun and it makes me want to watch the 1934 film (which makes an appearance in V for Vendetta) and read the book. I'm currently reading The Nordic Theory of Everything and will read The Stand after that, so I'll see if I can append it to my reading list.
