I am a firm believer in fusion food of all kinds. I'm not usually well versed enough in the cuisines of specific countries or regions to know when fusion food is created from subregions, but I'd like to think I can appreciate the food for its taste even if I'm in the dark about its history. I'm also thinking about how great sandwiches are.
