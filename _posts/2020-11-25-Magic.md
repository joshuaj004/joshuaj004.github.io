I've been playing a decent amount of Magic the Gathering lately, and it's actually a lot of fun. I'm playing the electronic version which has a lot of quality of life improvments. I never really got the hang of shuffling, I was always lucky enough to be friends with really good shufflers. There's also a lot of other counting assistance (e.g. cards in hand, deck, graveyard, etc...). It's also free (you can spend money, but you probably shouldn't). Happy Thanksgiving Eve!
