Buying stuff sucks. Specifically, buying stuff from physical ads/on craigslist sucks. I don't know what makes it suck, is it the people, the process, or some malevolent energy that manifests itself when there's a marketplace for buying/selling but it definitely is not good. There's even a German 'meme': "Was letzte Preis?" which translates to something like, "what is the cheapest price?" but also conveys that terrible experience and strange interactions that arise from selling something online. E.g. if you're trying to give away a couch for free, people will write to you asking if you could drop it off for them as well. A normal person would see that you're offering something for free and would understand that they'd have to pick it up or if you're feeling particularly generous at least meet you halfway. But for some reason people get an inch and try to take a mile.

Here's a list of things that suck/could be better about buying/selling on Craigslist:
* The "is it still available" message
    - There's nothing inherently wrong with this, but it signifies a point of friction in the process. As a buyer, I should never have to ask if something is available -- if it's in stock, it should show up as so and if it's not that should be obvious. This is the equivalent of commercial smalltalk.
    - There should be a way to show inventory in real time.
* Ads that could be any age
    - This is mostly a gripe with physical fliers that don't show how old they are. I have no idea if I should bother messaging this person because I don't know how long the ad has been up. I don't know why people post ads everywhere but then never take them down. That's basically littering! 
    - Obviously you should be able to see how old a posting is.
* Unresponsive sellers
    - Let me give you money! Why would you post an ad and then not respond as the seller? I have had cash in hand so many times and then I get ghosted. This is a ubiquitous experience and I can't understand why.
    - There should be an incentive for sellers to sell. I guess something other than money? I'm not sure what the solution is lol.
* Payment
    - I never know if I should bring cash or use something like venmo. I don't want to download a new app and set it up, so ideally payment should be as seamless as possible. 
    - This could be as simple as having payment processing done through stripe so that you can use a credit card to buy something without having to venmo a random person.

Could I do better? Well that's an interesting thought. What would an MVP look like?

### V0.1
A website where you can browse listings for existing products or create a listing for a product. Each listing would have a price, a description, a picture (or several), and contact information. 

### V0.2
Allow importing from Craigslist to automatically set up a new listing.

### V0.3
Allow multiple products in a listing with the ability to update the status of each product.

### V0.4
Allow a firm or negotiable price to be set for each product. If it's a firm price, discourage buyers from asking for a lower price.

### V0.5
Set up some some way to relay information so that people don't have to put their actual phone numbers/email address in.

Well that's about it for now.
