I decided yesterday that the best course of action was to start from scratch and that seems to be correct. I got a brand new machine, followed the [dockerswarm.rocks/](dockerswarm.rocks/) guide to the second page (traefik proxy with HTTPS) and as I'm typing this I'm thinking maybe I should continue to the end. Initially I decided against this because it looked like it was just monitoring, but maybe that'll reveal my issue. Anyways, I set up docker swarm and traefik and cloned my project and got it running. It actually works, but there is a certificate issue that I would like to resolve. This headway has given me a second wind and I'll continue the docker swarm stuff today!
