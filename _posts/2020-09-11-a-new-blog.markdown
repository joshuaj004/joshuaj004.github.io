Hello there! There is my new blog and hopefully my new personal website. I wanted to go with this format because I have a few different topics I want to write about and keep track of. I don't have a writing cadence at the moment, but I'm picturing a new post every day or so, at least until I run out of ideas. 

I have a few ideas at the moment including:
- Setting up this blog
- My experience with Jekyll as someone who hasn't used Ruby
- How I learned to cook
- Setting up a DigitalOcean Droplet + learning some of the ins and outs of managing a server

I'm sure there'll be more, but for now I've gotta make sure I can make this page go live!
