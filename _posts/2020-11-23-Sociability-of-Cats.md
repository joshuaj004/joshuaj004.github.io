I'm not sure how cats have earned a reputation for being anti social or hating people. In my experience, cats have been very loveable, perpetually interested and curious, and sometimes quite demanding in the attention they wish to receive. Sure cats can be more shy than dogs, but given enough time, some cats will really warm up to you. I have a cat that loves to be a part of any conversation. This includes when I'm on a zoom call or watching a video. He hears the voices, assumes something is happening, and demands to join. I have witnessed 3 cats sitting in a yard with their backs to each other, as if pretending the others weren't there. I'd bet my money on it that those cats would get up and leave if any one of those cats left. I wonder how many misconceptions I have about other animals that I just haven't had the chance to observe or further interact with.
