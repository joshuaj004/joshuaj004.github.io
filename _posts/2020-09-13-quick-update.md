Today is kind of a slow day. I did some more of the Linux Upskill Challenge and I'll probably be finished with it tomorrow. Additionally, I've been working through the [FastAPI tutorial](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/). It's quite thorough so it might take me another few days for the initial tutorial and then a little bit longer for the advanced tutorial. From the little I've done, I'm really liking it. In terms of setup, it's about as easy to set up as Flask (very easy) and it comes with a lot of features out of the box including automatic docs. I've had to write Swagger docs previously and it's not fun or interesting so getting them for free is nice. FastAPI also requires type hinting which should make it a lot easier to test because you *have* to have the type hints. It's also supposed to be really fast and performant, but this isn't something I can say for sure/have tested yet. Maybe once I have something built, I'll do some performance testing on it and see for sure. That's all for now folks!
