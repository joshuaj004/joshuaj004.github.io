I continued working on Viva La Vida, but I also tried Modest Mouse's Out Of Gas. Turns out that it is super easy to learn. I was able to learn just from the [Tabs](https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/modest-mouse/out-of-gas-tabs-106054). It took maybe 30 mins at most and I was able to practice when I was riding on my new stationary bike. It's been too cold and rainy to safely run outside and I had some Amazon gift cards just sitting there. I was able to save a little more money by purchasing used. Even though it was used, it looks brand new and I think it might actually be new. I put a little over 5 miles on it. If you haven't listened to Out Of Gas, I highly recommend it - you can listen on youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_heR2ekoxI). Really the whole album (The Lonesome Crowded West) is worth a listen.
