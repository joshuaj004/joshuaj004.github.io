It is in my opinion that there is a style of pizza _criminally_ underappreciated! Every hears about New York Style Pizza and Chicago style pizza, which are great in their own regards, but what about Detroit? I personally have not been outside of Detroit's airport so all the Detroit style pizza I've tried has been in NYC from Lions, Tigers, and Squares. Nonetheless, it has been very good each time! I usually go for the vodka sauce pizza, but I should probably branch out more. Some people object to eating pizza with cutlery, but I think it's justified in this case. Detroit style pizza isn't as soup-y/caserole-y as Chicago style pizza, but it is considerably thicker than most NY slices. It's about the same thickness as a Sicilian slice, which has a decent heft to it. Anyways, if you've never tried it, I highly recommend it at least once!
