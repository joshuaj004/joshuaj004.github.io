For some reason or another, my email account doesn't usually receive spam email. I think after years of not opening anything, my email slowly faded off of those spam lists. However, that was too peaceful and I've started getting a ridiculous amount of political spam. All these emails have insane titles too, like "Mitch McConnell in SHAMBLES" or "SLEEPY JOE NEEDS A NAP." I don't understand who clicks these things and I certainly did not sign up for these. Maybe we should charge a fee to send emails, but even then they'd probably still send them out. If everyone collectively decided they'd stop opening these emails, they would fade away to nothing. What a fairy tale huh?
