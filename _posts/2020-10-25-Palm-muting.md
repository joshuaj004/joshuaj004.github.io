I've been continuing with learning Viva La Vida on guitar and I've gotten the easy strumming pattern down, so I'm practicing the more advanced strumming pattern that uses palm muting. This is basically where you lay the flesh part of the side/bottom of your hand on the strings right by the bridge to 'mute' the sound. I'm still trying to get the hang of it, but it sounds like the video if I go slowly enough. I completely forgot about the 'speed' feature on youtube, but once I remembered and set the speed to 1/2 I was able to follow along so much better! Definitely use that if you're trying to follow a tutorial!
