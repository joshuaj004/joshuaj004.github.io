I feel like I haven't added any new recipes to my collection recently so when I happened upon a picture of Gnocci, I knew it was _the one_. It was this recipe for [Creamy Tuscan Sausage Gnocci](https://www.saltandlavender.com/creamy-tuscan-sausage-gnocchi/) and it was really good! I struggled getting the sausage meat out of the casings, but it ultimately didn't matter too much. I also subbed pecorino romano for the parmesan because it's overpriced at my local supermarket. The end result is a really nice dish that looks kinda like the Italian flag. On a sadder note, my heart goes out to those in Vienna. Vienna has a very special place in my heart and I wanted to express my solidarity with them.
