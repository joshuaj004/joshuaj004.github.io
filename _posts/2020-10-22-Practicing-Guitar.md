Today is probably the first day that I have felt good about practicing my guitar. When I started learning guitar, I started with the fundamentals because that seemed like the right idea. However, my interest tapered off for a few reasons, some of the guitar related, but I suspect the majority were relating to how I was feeling at the time. Anyways, learning chords in the abstract apparently does not motivate me, which is fine. I'm certain I can always go back to learn them. I see it in the same way as learning a language. Yes, fluency is a great thing to strive for, but what's more important to me is the ability to get my point across. Continuing with that analogy, while it would be great to be able to play _any_ song, I should start with a single song that I find interesting. I wanted to start with All Along The Watchtower, but I think it's a bit too complex for me at the moment. Viva La Vida by Coldplay is what I chose. It's a fun song and there are a couple ways of playing it, one of which is only 4 chords or so. I've been using [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgnNfb4f2TU) and it's really helpful. I'm able to play all of the chords, although switching from a C to a D and a D to a G is still something I stumble upon. More practice needed I suppose. In the video, Dave has a handy graphic to show the chords and I screenshotted + stitched them together for easy reference. It helped me and hopefully it'll help you as well. Do be aware that the D chord is wrong and your fingers should actually be moved back one fret.
