Yesterday I was all geared up to read The Count of Monte Cristo on my Kindle. My usual method for this is to go on Libby (a free app) and borrow an ebook through my library and then send it to my kindle. This usually takes about a minute so it's a lot easier (and currently safer) than going in person. However, it turns out that some books can be borrowed, but not sent to Kindle. I'm not sure why that is, but it's awfully inconvenient. I ended up getting a free ebook from [Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks), a website I've had great experiences with! I chose [Roughing It](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mark-twain/roughing-it) by Mark Twain and am excited to read it! It was a little more work than just sending it to my Kindle. It involved downloading the ebook and the thumbnail and loading them onto my Kindle which isn't a lot of work, but just a little friction. Maybe I'll see if I can do anything for them...
