Considering how impactful a good night's sleep is, it's kind of crazy to think how infrequently people get one. There are really easy things you can do to sleep better, e.g. don't use devices before bedtime, have your pets sleep in another room, turn off notifications on your phone. And still, people don't do it! There are things that I should be doing that I don't. I don't know why prioritizing something so healthy is rarely done. I am guilty of keeping weird hours and habits disruptive to sleep too. Maybe I should switch to using candles instead of lights... Anyways I'll be going to bed soon to lock in my 8 hours ðŸ’¤
