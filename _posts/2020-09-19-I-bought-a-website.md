I bought a website! Or 2! Or the domains for 2 websites!

Okay so what did I buy and how did I do it?

Sometime last week there was a [post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24506303) on HackerNews about searching for and registering domains on Godaddy and it was _not_ favorable. In the comments were lots of alternatives including Porkbun, Namecheap, Google Domains, and Gandi to name a few. I checked them out and decided I'd go with [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/) for a couple of reasons:

* The name. Come on, it's so cute!
* A bunch of good reviews on HN.
* They offer a few features for free including whois privacy.
* They were running a sale meaning I could pick up 2 domains for 2 years for about $12.
* They're based out of the PNW which holds a special place in my heart ðŸŒ²

I'll reveal the actual domains once there's some content on there (which'll hopefully be soon!).
