Even though yesterday I said I would figure out sendgrid, I underestimated how busy my day was going to be. For starters, I beat my mile time: 8m37s -> 8m26s which is very exciting. I also chatted with a company with some pretty passionate people in an interesting space. I did some reading on rabbitmq and celery. Lastly, I continued reading The Stand, so already it's been a busy day. 

I decided I wanted to make tacos for dinner, because I really like this recipe and it's been a while since I've made it. It's for [Pressure Cooker Chipotle-Honey Chicken Tacos](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020043-pressure-cooker-chipotle-honey-chicken-tacos) and they are _really_ good and not that difficult to make. I have an instant pot, so I basically add a bunch of ingredients into the pot, pressure cook, shred the chicken, add some beans, and it's ready. Unfortunately, I don't have all the ingredients so I need to run to the store, although that shouldn't take too long. I'm looking forward to this meal!
