Yesterday I wrote up this post and then didn't actually commit it. Oh no, my nice green github contributions page is sullied. I did a couple searches for how to change the time and date on a commit and there were a few good answers. But ultimately, what is the point? I'm not writing this blog to get a full github contributions chart. There are more important things, like that I shaved 30s off my mile time! Yesterday I ran an 8m10s mile and it would've been faster if I hadn't been stuck behind people at 2 separate points on my run >:( Yesterday I had a couple good chats with some companies doing interesting work. I watched West Wing. My point is that there's no reason to worry if I can't write one of these everyday, especially if I'm busy actually living my life. That said, I will try to write something everyday if for no other reason than I enjoy it.
