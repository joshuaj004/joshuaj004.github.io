I've done a few more days of the Linux Upskill Challenge and read through the getting started tutorial for FastAPI so I'm feeling pretty good at the moment. I think my next step with FastAPI is to use the [Full Stack FastAPI and PostgreSQL project generator](https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-postgresql) and try to play around with that. On a previous personal project, I sort of got stuck with the user creation and authentication phase so having the skeleton should be helpful for moving past that.

On another note, I've been toying around with the idea of getting some freelancing work. I've found [this HackerNews comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13209020) from almost 4 years ago that should give me some places to start. After working remotely for the past several months, it's gonna take a lot to get me to go back into an office. My current strategy will be to apply for some full time remote jobs and simultaneously register for a few of these freelancing sites. I'm not sure what the timeline for getting a project is, but I'll write about it when I find out.
