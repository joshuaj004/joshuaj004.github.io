So I finally got around to setting up a personal website about a week ago and it looked very nice (I used a template which handled the styling and the mobile compatibility), but it wasn't really what I was hoping to get out of a personal website. I sort of threw it up there as an electronic business card, but what I'm hoping for is a very casual blog that won't require a lot (or any, preferably) maintenance. 

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a good candidate because it is free and there's a bunch of tutorials for getting it up and ready. I ran the [quickstart](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) and read some of the docs and was up and running pretty quickly. Because it's on Github Pages, you can view the public repo [here](https://github.com/joshuaj004/joshuaj004.github.io). There really isn't that much to it, you just create a new file and Jekyll handles all the generating of the relevant files.

### Future Work

I might decide to switch up how the blog looks and use a theme. It seems there are tons of them available, but I don't wanna spend too much time before I'm sure that I'll stick with this blog.
